# Polyp-Segmentation

This repository contains code for the project **Polyp Segmentation in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy Images**. The aim of the project is to segment the [polyps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)), if any, in WCE images of the patients. Thus, an automated system is developed based on U-Net inspired cnn network. Also, the applicability of some state-of-the-art methods like [Linknet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03718.pdf), [FPN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03144.pdf), [PSPNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01105.pdf), for this dataset is also analysed.
